## About

This Repo is scheduled to automatically update (and it's lists) at least every 24 hours.

Lists are to be used with an adblocker solution which supports the "adguard" list format, an example: [AdGuardHome](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome)

----


Use the RAW files [linked](#the-lists) below this [README](https://github.com/SystemJargon/filters/blob/main/README.md) file in your AdGuard/Adblock solution. 

Notes:

* Some lists are defined as a blocklist or some an allowlist. Each list has a description or purpose for what it does, i.e allow, block telemetry.

* All lists (so the lines within) will have syntax validated and be de-duplicated. Some may have comments stripped. This is mostly to ensure file sizes (plus download/update times) are managable and future scalable. I may create releases to make this point mentioned, easier.

* You can check my aggregation of sources used in this repo [here](https://github.com/SystemJargon/filters/tree/main/source). Each txt list has a corresponding named JSON file.

<!-- The aggregation of some lists are from my [blocklists](https://github.com/systemjargon/blocklists) or [allowlists](https://github.com/systemjargon/allowlists) repositories. -->


* Feel free to ðŸŒŸ/star the repo.
