## DNS Blocklists & Allowlist/s

Because Ads, Telemetry and some content and/or domains are just out right **** that should be blocked.

Lists are to be used with something alike Pi-Hole, AdGuard, AdGuardHome or similar. These lists may also work in browser based adblockers, but would need to interpret adblock/hosts formats.

I provide adblock and hosts formats currently. I can make lists in other formats on request if you create an issue (request).

Info about formats using [Pi-Hole](https://pi-hole.net/blog/2023/03/22/pi-hole-ftl-v5-22-web-v5-19-and-core-v5-16-1-released#page-content) [Adblock](https://easylist.to/) and [AdGuard](https://adguard.com/kb/general/ad-filtering/create-own-filters/)

This Repo is scheduled to automatically update (and it's lists) on a schedule regularly.

Leaving a :star: is much appreciated

Use the RAW files [linked](#the-lists) below this [README](https://github.com/SystemJargon/filters/blob/main/README.md) file in your AdGuard/Adblock solution. 

Notes:

* Some lists are defined as a ðŸš« blocklist or some an âœ… allowlist. Each list has a description or purpose for what it does, i.e allow, block telemetry.

* All lists will have syntax validated and be de-duplicated. Some may have comments stripped. This is mostly to ensure file sizes and length are usable and scalable.

* The aggregation of lists are either my own lists, repositories and other well curated lists.

<!--* If you want my big Social Media Blocklist, see [here](https://github.com/SystemJargon/blocklists/blob/main/lists/categories/social-media/SystemJargon_Block_SocialMedia_AG.txt) or look in my blocklists repo under the Category of Social Media [here](https://github.com/SystemJargon/blocklists/blob/main/lists/categories/social-media) Add the no-social-media list -->

* Again feel free to ðŸŒŸ/star the repo.
