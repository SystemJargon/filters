### The purpose of this list is to un-break sites so they load properly but still maintain the core function of blocking ads or mitigating security etc.
### Usually this should be on an allowlist or in your own custom filtering rules. This exists just to showcase exceptions/allowlists needed.
### This is usually where another aggregated list wont fix an issue on GitHub, if a site is blocked - example remove it from an adlist.
### EXAMPLE BLOCK MOST COMMON SUB-DOMAIN graph.facebook.com which is on a few blocklists. Example https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jerryn70/GoodbyeAds/master/Hosts/GoodbyeAds.txt
